Problems that your team ran into and how your team overcame them:
Not having much Unity experience (nor game development experience for that matter) we ran into many challenges. There were many features we needed for our game that we did not know how to implement, so we had to learn it on the spot. We also have very little experience in creating pixel art and sprites. Overall, it was a very intense learning curve, but we definitely grew as game developers.
